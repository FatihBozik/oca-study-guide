== Polymorphism

=== Object vs Reference

1. The type of the object determines which properties exist within the object in memory.

2. The type of the reference to the object determines which methods and variables are
accessible to the Java program.

=== Casting Objects

Here are some basic rules to keep in mind when casting variables

1. Casting an object from subclass to a superclass doesn't require a explicit cast.

2. Casting object from a superclass to a subclass requires an explicit cast.

3. The compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types.

4. Even when the code compiles without issue, an exception may be thrown at runtime
if the object being cast is not actually an instance of that class.
